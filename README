This project is a simple downloader that downloads all files from an amazon s3 
bucket when it is invoked via the command line in the following manner:-

java -jar amazondownloader-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
    [-repoid <yourbucketname>]
    [-objectid <objectid>]
    [-ls]
    [-download][-waittime <time in milliseconds>]

Your default bucket name, access key and secret access key are defined within
the spring.xml with src/main/resources

The parameters in spring.xml are the following: -

***YOURDEFAULTBUCKETNAME***
***YOURACCESSKEY***
***YOURSECRETACCESSKEY***

Simply replace the above text within spring.xml with the correct values.

You can also replace https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com within the spring.xml
file with another s3 region url if so required.

The project was built within NetBeans IDE 8.0 and is maven based.

For some reason you will need to do a normal build (Run->Build Project) and then 
select amazondownloader with the project window and double click on 
'assembly single' within the navigator to which create a jar file with all 
dependencies within it (if you select assembly single first it create the jar
file but it doesnt work)...I will figure it out later :)
